Example programs attached to a research paper: "a formal approach for secured risk assessment."

You can obtain the analysis results and attack graphs of Model-0/1/2 by running "update.sh".
The analysis programs are written in Python 3.10.6.

As part of the analysis, "update.sh" calls "dot - graphviz version 2.43.0 (0)".
You can comment out those lines starting with "dot" if you do not need SVG files of the generated attack graphs.
